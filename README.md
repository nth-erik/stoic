## FAQ

- Q: Are you one of these braindead evangelists who thinks we should just random-roll our functions?
- A: No, but I'm also not a masochist: On the other hand, the AI is a tireless coder an intelligent developer can brainstorm with, addressing potential points of failure, and reason about cryptic implementation choices. This way I can focus on refining and improving on the initial solution with a mix of follow-up questions and manual optimization for quality assessment from both ends.

- Q: Is this it? Three classes, one just a factory?
- A: Yeah, it's not even minimized, so anyone can take a look and tell me why it sucks.
